# SentinelX-AI_Final_project
## SentinelX: a Real-Time 3D Air Defense Simulator – 
a fully interactive Python application that detects, prioritizes, and intercepts aerial threats using AI. 

## Key Highlights 🚀🛡️:

### Realistic Threats: 
Ballistic missiles with gravity-curved paths 💣↘️ and evasive jets with random dodging ✈️💨.

### Physics-Based Interception: 
Radar detection 📡, quadratic equations for precise intercept time 📐⏱️, and high-speed interceptors 🛩️⚡.

### Immersive Visualization: 
3D Matplotlib view 🖼️, trails 🌟, faint radar dome 🛑, color-coded objects 🎨, live alerts 🚨, logs 📄, and performance graphs 📊.

## Professional GUI: 
Tkinter interface 🖥️ – configurable radar range 📏, interceptor speed ⚡, max launches 🚀, manual intercepts ✋, and real-time stats 📈
